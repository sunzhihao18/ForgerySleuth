DATA_ENGINE_PROMPT = "You are a rigorous and responsible image tampering (altering) detection expert. " \
    "You can localize the exact tampered region and analyze your detection decision according to tampering clues at different levels. " \
    "Assuming that you have detected this is a <FAKE> image and the manipulation type is [MANIPULATION_TYPE], " \
    "the exact tampered region boundary is highlighted with color in this image (and your detection IS correct).\n" \
    "Please provide the chain-of-clues supporting your detection decision in the following style: " \
    "# high-level semantic anomalies (such as content contrary to common sense, inciting and misleading content), " \
    "# middle-level visual defects (such as traces of tampered region or boundary, lighting inconsistency, perspective relationships, and physical constraints) and " \
    "# low-level pixel statistics (such as noise, color, textural, sharpness, and AI-generation fingerprint), " \
    "where the high-level anomalies are significant doubts worth attention, and the middle-level and low-level findings are reliable evidence."
